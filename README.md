This is a simple barcode scanner app built with SwiftUI. It uses the device's camera to scan EAN-8 and EAN-13 barcodes, displaying the scanned code or an error message on the screen.

### Key Technologies and Patterns:

* **UI Framework**: The application is built entirely with **SwiftUI**. It uses a `NavigationView` for the main screen structure and a `VStack` to layout elements vertically.
* **Architecture**: It uses the **MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel)** pattern.
    * **Model**: The `AlertItem` struct serves as a simple model for displaying alerts.
    * **View**: `BarcodeScannerView` is the main view, and `ScannerView` is the component that hosts the camera.
    * **ViewModel**: `BarcodeScannerViewModel` is an `ObservableObject` that holds the application's state, such as the `scannedCode` and any `alertItem` to be displayed.
* **State Management**:
    * **`@StateObject`**: To create and manage the lifecycle of the `BarcodeScannerViewModel`.
    * **`@Published`**: To automatically announce changes to properties like `scannedCode` from the ViewModel to the View.
    * **`@Binding`**: To create a two-way connection between the `BarcodeScannerView` and the `ScannerView`, allowing the camera component to update the state in the parent view.
* **UIKit Integration**:
    * **`UIViewControllerRepresentable`**: Used to wrap a UIKit `UIViewController` (`ScannerVC`) so it can be used within the SwiftUI view hierarchy. This is the core mechanism for displaying the live camera feed.
    * **Delegate Pattern**: A custom `ScannerVCDelegate` protocol is used to communicate events (like finding a barcode or encountering an error) from the UIKit `ScannerVC` back to the SwiftUI world via a `Coordinator`.
* **AVFoundation**: This is the underlying Apple framework used within `ScannerVC` to access the camera, set up a capture session, and process metadata to detect barcodes.
